		/*1.MultiTasking:
		    Executing several tasks simultaneously is a concept of multitasking .
		  
		  2.Types of Multitasking  
		    Process based
		    Thread based
		    
		  3.Process Based:  
		    Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent
		    program(Process) is called process based multitasking
		    eg:While typing a Java program in the editor we can listen audio songs from
		    same system.At the same time we can download a file from net all these tasks will
		    be executed simultaneously and independent of each other. Hence it is process
		    based multitasking. Process based multitasking is best suitable at OS level
		    
		  4. Thread based
		     Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent
		     part of same program is called thread based multitasking.And each independent part
		     is called a thread.Thread based multitasking is best suitable at program level
		  
		  5.Advantage of Multitasking
		    Whether it is process based or thread based the main objective of multitasking is
		    to reduce the response time of the system and to improve the performance
		    
		  6.Uses of Multithreading concept     
		    The main important application areas of a multi threading are to develop multimedia
		    graphics, to develop animations, to develop vedio games 
		    
		    When compared with old languages developing multithreaded applications in java is very 
		    easy because Java provides inbuilt support for multi threading with rich API(thread runnable,thread group..)
