	Super Keyword used to access /call the parent class members(Variables or methods).
	Super Keyword is mostly used in Overriding methods.When we call a method with the same
	name from a parent class we will be using "Super" Keyword .	
	Remember  the call to super() must be the first statement in each constructor 
	Also Note even a abstract classes can have constructors however we cant instantiate the
	abstract class using the new keyword
	Note : In the static block we will not be able to use the super or This keyword 
	Also constructor cant have both super and this
