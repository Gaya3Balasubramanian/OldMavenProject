	/* Collections :
	   
	   1.Collections are growable in nature . That is based on our req we can add or 
	     decrease the size
	     
	   2.With respected to memory Collections are recommended to use
	   
	   3.With respected to performance collections are not recommended to use 
	   
	    4.Collections can hold both homo and hetero
	    
	    5.Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure 
		  hence for every requirement ready made method support is available .Being a
		  Programmer we are responsible to use those methods and we are not responsible 
		  to implement those methods.
		  
		 6.Collections can hold only object types not primitives      
		  
		   
		   
	              
	             
	                                    
	                                    
	                                    
	                                    
	                                    
	                                    
	    Arrays:                                
	    
	    1.Arrays are fixed in size . That is once we create array we cant increase or
	      decrease the size based on our req.  
	      
	    2.With respected to memory arrays are not recommended to use 
	    
	    3.With respected to performance arrays are  recommended to use 
	                                    
	    4.Arrays can hold only homogeneous  data only
	    
	    5.There is no underlying data structure for arrays. And hence ready made method support
	      is not available.For every requirement we have to write the code explicitly which increases
	       the complexity of programming
	       
	    6.Arrays can hold both primitives and objects .
