		/*1.When the collections concept came? 
		    a.Initially we were using above method.Disadvantage of above method is when we want 
		      want to use more number of data we will not be able to use above method
		  
		   b. An array is an indexed collection of  fixed number of homogeneous data elements 
		      The main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values by using single    
		      variable . So that readability of code will be improved .Then we moved to arrays concept .we can store more number of data . But there 
		      are few disadvantage in using arrays concept too. Disadvantages are:
		      a. Fixed in size: Once we set the arrays size we cant change back based on our req.Due
		         to this to use arrays concept compulsory we should know the size in advance which
		         may may not possible always 
		      b.Homogenous in nature :Arrays can hold only homogeneous data type elements . Above
		        is an example. We can solve this problem using object type arrays
		        
		      C.Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure.
		        and hence ready made method support is not  available .For every requirement
		        we have to write the code explicitly which increases the complexity of programming
		        
		       Collections:    
		       To overcome above problems of arrays we should go for collections concept
		       
		           
		       Collections are growable in nature . That is based on our requirement we can 
		       increase or decrease the size    
		        
		        
		       Collection can hold both homo and hetero elements.
		       
		        Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure 
		        hence for every requirement ready made method support is available .Being a
		        Programmer we are responsible to use those methods and we are not responsible 
		        to implement those methods. 
		        
		        
		       What is Collections?
		       
		       If we want to represent a group of individual objects has a single entity
		       then we should go for collection.
		       
		        
		       Collections framework contains several classes and interfaces which can be 
		       used to represent a group of individual object into single entity.
